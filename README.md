Options
=======

__`opening_brace` & `closing_brace`:__ These options allow you to modify the kind of braces the plugin will insert.<br>

    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+i"], "command": "indent_and_braces", "args": { "opening_brace": "[", "closing_brace": "]" } },

__`from_cursor`:__ Normally the plugin will determine intelligently wether or not to place the opening brace on a new line. If you want to force this, you can use `from_cursor`.<br>

    { "keys": ["ctrl+j"], "command": "indent_and_braces", "args": { "from_cursor": false} },
